This plugin enables Google AJAX Language API on your blog, so your blog readers can easily translate your blog comments into other languages.

== Description ==

The Google AJAX Translation WordPress plugin provides a quick, simple and light way to add internationalization feature onto your blog.

In the current version(0.1.*) I only enabled comment translation by default. This is because Google Ajax Translate only allow 500 characters right now (March 2008). But the function was already implemented, please feel free to uncomment line 84 if you want to try it.


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'ajaxtranslation.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory, or put the google-ajax-translation folder into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Google AJAX Translation.
4. Have fun with your blog readers.
