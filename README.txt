This plugin enables Google AJAX Language API on your blog, so your blog readers can easily translate your blog posts or comments into other languages.

== Description ==

The Google AJAX Translation WordPress plugin provides a quick, simple and light way to add internationalization feature onto your blog.

<a href="http://blog.libinpan.com/2008/08/04/google-ajax-translation-wordpress-plugin/">Google AJAX Translation WordPress Plugin V0.2.0</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.libinpan.com/2008/03/21/introducing-the-google-ajax-translation-wordpress-plugin/">Google AJAX Translation WordPress Plugin</a>

In the current version(0.2.*) I only enabled comment translation by default, but you can enable post translation yourself from the admin page. And please keep this in mind: Google Ajax Translate only allow 500 characters right now (March 2008).


== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'ajaxtranslation.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory, or put the google-ajax-translation folder into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Google AJAX Translation.
4. Have fun with your blog readers.
5. Change the settings from Setting -> Google Translation Admin Page
